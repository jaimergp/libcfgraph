  "description": "uutils is an attempt at writing universal (as in cross-platform) CLI utilities in Rust.\nuutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible,\nto be able to use the same utils on Linux, Mac, Windows and other platforms.\nThis ensures, for example, that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.\nRust was chosen not only because it is fast and safe,\nbut is also excellent for writing cross-platform code.\n",
